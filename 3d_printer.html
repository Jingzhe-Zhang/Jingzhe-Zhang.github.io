            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <img src="printer_render.png" alt="CAD render of 3D printer" class="project-image">
            <p>This custom 3D printer was designed and built from scratch to address the limitations of off-the-shelf printers while incorporating advanced features. The project focused on combining cutting-edge firmware, optimized mechanics, and enhanced usability for a versatile and efficient printing solution.</p>

            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Klipper Firmware Integration:</strong> Wireless control and real-time adjustment capabilities enabled a 2x increase in print speed compared to similarly priced printers.</li>
                <li><strong>Chamber Heating:</strong> A custom-designed chamber heater achieves 70°C in under 10 minutes, reducing material warping by 30%, especially for high-temperature filaments like ABS and nylon.</li>
                <li><strong>Triple Z-Belt Automatic Leveling:</strong> Eliminated the need for manual bed leveling, significantly enhancing first-layer consistency and reducing setup time.</li>
                <li><strong>Compact but Efficient Design:</strong> Optimized the frame to house a 165mm x 165mm print bed within a 280mm footprint, achieving a 60% bed-to-frame ratio while maintaining rigidity.</li>
                <li><strong>Custom Motion and Thermal Management:</strong> Redesigned frame and motion system minimized print artifacts, and advanced thermal management ensured consistent print quality.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
            <p>This project involved overcoming several challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Print Artifacts:</strong> Initial frame designs caused vibrations that resulted in print imperfections. This was resolved by redesigning the frame for increased rigidity and optimizing infill settings during printing.</li>
                <li><strong>Wireless Setup:</strong> Klipper firmware required customization to interface with the printer’s electronics, which I resolved through extensive research and community engagement on Discord forums.</li>
                <li><strong>Heat Management:</strong> Achieving uniform chamber temperatures required careful placement of heating elements and insulation, ensuring stable performance for high-temperature materials.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="centered-text">I built this custom 3D printer from the ground up to overcome the limitations of commercial models. Unlike standard printers that require frequent maintenance and handle a limited range of materials, my printer offers superior performance and versatility. It supports a wide variety of filaments, including high-temperature materials like ABS and nylon, thanks to its advanced hotend and heated bed. A chamber heater ensures stable printing conditions for demanding materials, while an integrated air filtration system manages fumes and reduces noise. The compact, boxy design makes the printer portable and space-efficient. Additionally, the Klipper firmware's online interface allows for seamless wireless operation without the need for an SD card.</p>

            <h2 class="centered-title">Key Features</h2>
            <div class="key-features-container">
                <ul class="centered-text-key">
                    <li><strong>Klipper Firmware Integration:</strong> Enables wireless control and real-time adjustments, resulting in a twofold increase in print speed compared to similarly priced printers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chamber Heating:</strong> A custom-designed chamber heater reaches 70°C in under 10 minutes, reducing material warping by 30%, especially for high-temperature filaments like ABS and nylon.</li>
                    <li><strong>Triple Z-Belt Automatic Leveling:</strong> Eliminates the need for manual bed leveling, significantly enhancing first-layer consistency and reducing setup time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compact but Efficient Design:</strong> Optimized frame accommodates a 165mm x 165mm print bed within a 280mm footprint, achieving a 60% bed-to-frame ratio while maintaining rigidity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Material Compatibility:</strong> Supports a wide range of filaments, including PCCF and nylon, expanding the possibilities for diverse printing projects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integrated Air Filtration System:</strong> Safely handles fumes from materials like ABS, ensuring a healthier printing environment and reducing operational noise.</li>
